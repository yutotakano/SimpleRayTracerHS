# SimpleRayTracerHS

This is RayTracer built in Haskell, for the Functional Programming competition at University of Edinburgh. 

Details are a secret until the competition is over.

## Command-line arguments:

```
--shadow        Turns on the shadow if specified. 
--single        Renders only first frame.
--res 192:108   Specifies the output resolution.
```

## Libraries

- JuicyPixels

## Some measurements:

- Time it takes to render 1 frame 1920x1080, no shadows: ~3 minutes
- Time it takes to render 1 frame 1920x1080, with shadows: ~180 minutes
